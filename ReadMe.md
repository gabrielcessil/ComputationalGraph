# **Computational Graph-Based Automatic Differentiation**

## **Project Overview**
In modern numerical computing and machine learning, **automatic differentiation (AutoDiff)** plays a crucial role in efficiently computing gradients for optimization problems. This project implements a **computational graph-based automatic differentiation system**, where mathematical expressions are represented as **directed graphs**. Each node in the graph corresponds to an operation (e.g., addition, multiplication, sine, power), while edges capture dependencies between variables.

---

## **Project Features**
- A class-based implementation of a computational graph, allowing users to construct expressions dynamically.
- Support for common mathematical operations (addition, multiplication, exponentiation, trigonometric functions).
- Graph-based differentiation, enabling efficient computation of gradients via backpropagation.
- A structured visualization of the computational graph, helping users understand function composition.

# **Example**

## **Let's define the following function \\( f(x,y,z) \\)**

\[
f(x,y,z) = (xy + y^{\sin(z)})xy
\]

## **Where the partial derivatives are analytically defined as:**

\[
\frac{df}{dx} = y(2xy+y^{\sin(z)})
\]

\[
\frac{df}{dy} = x(2xy+\sin(z)y^{\sin(z)}+y^{\sin(z)})
\]

\[
\frac{df}{dz} = x\ln(y)\cos(z)y^{\sin(z)+1}
\]

### **With these analytical forms, we can verify the numerical results of the computational graph.**


## **Given:**
x = 1;

y = 3;

z = 0.5;

 **Unfornutelly, the current state of the code still do not support matrices.**
